      <h3>
      I'm excited you're here!
      </h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the exciting world of game development! In this course we are
        going to embark on a journey that will help you transform your creative
        ideas into a fully functional game. Get ready to turn the universe inside
        your mind into a real-world experience by developing and delivering a game
        you’ll be proud to share!
      </p>
      <h3>What will we do?</h3>
      <p>
        Through a hands-on, competency-based approach, you’ll have the
        opportunity to develop the technical,
        design, and problem-solving skills necessary to bring your vision to life.
        Whether you’re new to game development or looking to sharpen your skills,
        this course is designed to guide you through every step of the process,
        culminating in a final game contest where you’ll showcase your creation.
      </p>

      <h3>How will I evaluate you?</h3>
      <p>
        You will be evaluated based on your demonstration of specific game development
        <a href="comps.html">competencies</a> through tangible
        deliverables. The alpha, beta, gold candidate, and marketing materials will
        serve as the primary evidence of these competencies. We will also
        <a href="evals.html">meet together</a> a few times throughout the
          course to evaluate your evidence and discuss it together.
      </p>

      <h3>What is our schedule?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="unit01.html">Introduction</a> (Week 1)</li>
        <li><a href="unit02.html">Fundamentals</a> (Week 2-3)</li>
        <li><a href="unit03.html">Alpha Kickoff</a> (Week 4-5)</li>
        <li><a href="unit04.html">Alpha Expansion</a> (Week 6-7)</li>
        <li><a href="unit05.html">Beta Kickoff</a> (Week 8-9)</li>
        <li><a href="unit06.html">Beta Completion</a> (Week 10-11)</li>
        <li><a href="unit07.html">Gold Candidate</a> (Week 12-13)</li>
        <li><a href="unit08.html">Game Contest</a> (Week 14)</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What about late work?</h3>
      <p>
        You should keep up with the schedule but you will not be penalized if there
        are times when you can't. We have a final project deadline corresponding
        with the game contest and that's what matters here. This is
        definitely a two-edged sword though. We'll talk more about what this
        means for you, in detail, when we're in class together.
      </p>

      <h3>Who will help you?</h3>
      <p>
        The instructor and teaching assistants are here to guide you, answer
        questions, and provide feedback on your work. There are also extensive
        online resources, including the game engine documentation, tutorials,
        forums, and community support, as well as numerous articles and books on
        game development.
      </p>

      <h3>Starting on the right foot.</h3>
      <p>
        While we provide the structure, tools, and opportunities to succeed, it is
        ultimately up to you to engage with the course and take ownership of
        your learning. This experience is designed to empower you to explore,
        experiment, and grow your skills, but your dedication and effort will
        determine how much you achieve. Remember, we are here to help you, but the
        journey to mastering game development is yours to embrace!
      </p>
      <h3>A final important thought.</h3>
      <p>
        Games have the power to inspire, teach, and bring joy to people of all ages.
        The world needs more thoughtful and positive content, and your efforts in
        this course contribute to that. By developing games that educate, uplift
        and encourage balance, you are directly helping others and making the
        world a better place. What could be more disciple-like than that?
