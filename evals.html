      <h2>Evaluations</h2>
      <br/>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the course, we will have three one-on-one evaluation meetings
        to review your work and assess your progress toward mastering the course
        competencies. These meetings are designed to provide you with clear,
        constructive feedback on your skills and to help you understand where you
        stand in relation to the course competencies.
      </p>
      <h3>Evidence</h3>
      <p>
        To support this process, you’ll use a GitHub repository to commit your code
        throughout the course. This repository will serve as a transparent and
        organized record of your work, which we will reference during our meetings.
        Additionally, at the end of each module, you will submit a brief video—1-2
        minutes in length—where you walk me through your work. These videos should
        explain the challenges you faced, describe how you addressed them, and
        demonstrate your solutions.
        </p>
      <p>Think of these as “video stand-ups,” giving you the opportunity to account
        for your progress and reflect on your
        problem-solving strategies. Beyond being an evaluation tool, these videos
        also help me understand where you are in your learning journey, enabling me
        to provide targeted feedback or additional help between our scheduled
        meetings.
      </p>
      <h3>Format</h3>
      <p>
        During our evaluation meetings, we will discuss your code, your video
        submissions, and how well your work aligns with the course competencies.
        These conversations are collaborative and forward-looking, focusing on
        identifying strengths, addressing areas for improvement, and clarifying
        expectations. By the final meeting, you will have received ample feedback
        and opportunities to refine your skills. This iterative process ensures
        that your final grade is a fair and comprehensive reflection of your growth
        and achievements over time.
      </p>
      <h3>Final Grade</h3>
      <p>While the first two meetings will result in provisional letter grades to
        signal your performance, these grades are not final. Instead, they serve as
        checkpoints, offering insights into your progress and providing actionable
        guidance to help you refine your work. The final meeting, held at the end of
        the course, will determine your overall letter grade. This is based on
        your demonstrated achievement of the course competencies in alignment
        with the
        <a href="https://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system">
          descriptions of letter grades
        </a> in the university catalog.
